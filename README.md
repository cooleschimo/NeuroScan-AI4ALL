# NeuroScan: AI-Powered Brain Aneurysm Detection System

**NeuroScan** is a full-stack medical AI application for detecting brain vessel abnormalities (aneurysms) from MRA scans. This repo contains the complete system: frontend interface, inference backend, and model training code.

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** To what extent can AI detect abnormal vessel patterns in brain MRA scans compared to manual radiologist review?

NeuroScan serves as an AI-powered triage tool to assist radiologists in detecting potentially life-threatening brain aneurysms. The system:

- Flags potential aneurysms for clinical review (does not replace radiologist judgment)
- Reduces diagnostic burden by pre-screening scans during high-volume shifts
- Works with lower-resolution data (64×64×64 voxels) to support under-resourced healthcare settings
- Achieves 83.72% sensitivity on the validation set, approaching the ~95% sensitivity reported in clinical MRA studies

## Repository Structure

This repo contains three main components:

## Model Training & Research

### Overview
Research code for training and evaluating the 3D CNN on the VesselMNIST3D dataset. This work was completed as part of the **AI4ALL Ignite accelerator**.

### Key Results
- **81.4% recall** (sensitivity) on aneurysm detection
- **87.3% specificity**
- Successfully detected **35 out of 43** test aneurysms
- Addressed 8:1 class imbalance using WeightedRandomSampler
- Optimized threshold to minimize false negatives (patient safety priority)

### Limitations Identified
- **Low resolution** (64×64×64 voxels) limits detection of subtle aneurysms
- **Unknown demographics** in dataset reduces generalizability
- **Class imbalance** requires careful training strategies
- **11+ percentage point gap** compared to clinical MRA (~95% sensitivity)

### Dataset
- **Source:** VesselMNIST3D from MedMNIST v2
- **Original:** Intra: 3D Intracranial Aneurysm Dataset (Xi Yang et al., CVPR 2020)
- **Size:** 1,335 training / 191 validation / 382 test samples
- **Imbalance:** ~8:1 ratio (healthy:aneurysm)

### Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, MONAI
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- matplotlib for visualization
- Google Colab (T4 GPU)

### Training Code

## Current Performance

| Metric | Value | Clinical MRA Studies |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Sensitivity (Recall)** | 83.72% | ~95% |
| **Specificity** | 87.3% | N/A |
| **Resolution** | 64×64×64 voxels | 512×512×200+ voxels |

**Performance Gap:** While comparatively accurate given the resolution constraints, there remains an 11+ percentage point gap compared to clinical standards.

**Room for Improvement:**
- Higher-resolution training data
- Expanded dataset with diverse demographics
- Architectural refinements (attention mechanisms, multi-scale processing)
- Ensemble methods

## Research Background

### Problem Statement
To what extent can AI detect abnormal vessel patterns in brain MRA scans compared to manual radiologist review?

Stroke prevention and early detection of vascular abnormalities rely heavily on accurate interpretation of brain MRA scans. Radiologists review these images manually, a process that is:
- Time-consuming and vulnerable to fatigue
- Affected by high patient volumes and long shifts
- Subject to human error, especially for subtle findings

This project explores whether AI can provide meaningful assistance in this critical diagnostic task.

### Clinical Context
- 6.5 million people in the US have unruptured brain aneurysms
- 30,000 ruptures occur annually
- 50% mortality rate once ruptured
- Radiologist fatigue increases errors by 226% at high shift volumes (67-90 vs ≤19 studies)
- Sub-Saharan Africa has <1 radiologist per 500,000 people

NeuroScan addresses these challenges by providing automated pre-screening that flags obvious aneurysms for immediate clinical review, reducing the cognitive burden on radiologists during high-volume shifts. By working with lower-resolution data and supporting older 1.5T MRI systems, the tool also extends advanced screening capabilities to under-resourced healthcare settings where specialist access and healthcare manpower is limited.
